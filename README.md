# CS-101-Projects
A collection of my projects for CS 101, or Computer Science II for Majors.

Project 1 - Network:

Reads from an input file with a network source, destination, and bandwith and prints to an output file each unique identifier followed by all of the leaf identifiers source bandwith, destination bandwith, and average between the two.

Project 2 - Index Sorting:

Reads from an input file of strings or integers and sorts them according to the indices in a separate sort file using MergeSort. Strings are sorted according to their indices as usual; however integers are read from right to left and sorted as such.

Project 3 -  Viewership:

Console application that stores user-input Media in a linked list entitled MediaList. Each media has a name and a linked list of regions, while each region has an associated name and viewer count. Program also follows the Rule of Three, containing a destructor, deep copy constructor, and deep copy assignment operator.
