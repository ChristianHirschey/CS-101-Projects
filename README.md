# CS-101-Projects
A collection of my projects for CS 101.

Project 1 - Network:

Reads from an input file with a network source, destination, and bandwith and prints to an output file each unique identifier followed by all of the leaf identifiers source bandwith, destination bandwith, and average between the two.
