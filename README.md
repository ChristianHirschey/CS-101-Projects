# CS-101-Projects
A collection of my projects for CS 101, or Computer Science II for Majors.

# Project 1 - Network:

Reads from an input file with a network source, destination, and bandwith and prints to an output file each unique identifier followed by all of the leaf identifiers source bandwith, destination bandwith, and average between the two.

# Project 2 - Index Sorting:

Reads from an input file of strings or integers and sorts them according to the indices in a separate sort file using MergeSort. Strings are sorted according to their indices as usual; however integers are read from right to left and sorted as such.

# Project 3 -  Viewership:

Console application that stores user-input Media in a linked list entitled MediaList. Each media has a name and a linked list of regions, while each region has an associated name and viewer count. Also follows the Rule of Three in C++, containing a destructor, deep copy constructor, and deep copy assignment operator.

# Project 4 - Hash Tables and People:

Console application that reads names, ids, e-mails, and similar related data from a text file and stores into a Hash Table implemented as a vector of lists with double hashing as collision resolution. The insert and find operations are highly optimized, being run in O(1) time.

# Project 5 - Compression:

Reads from an input text file, storing each ASCII character's frequency in an STL map. Utilizes Huffman Compression implemented through a MinHeap to drastically reduce the number of bits needed to represent the text file.
